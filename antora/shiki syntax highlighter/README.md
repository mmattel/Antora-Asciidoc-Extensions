# Shiki Syntax Highligher

[Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/) is a syntax highlighter powered by the same language grammars used in Visual Studio Code, ensuring accurate and consistent code coloring. It offers a wide range of themes and can tokenize code in any language that VS Code supports, making it highly versatile. Unlike many highlighters, Shiki pre-processes code into colored HTML at build time, offering improved performance and consistency across different environments.

Note that this extension has its own repository and is referenced here only. For more details including a detailed description see the [Antora Shiki Extension](https://github.com/lask79/antora-shiki-extension) repository.
